A hamburger, burger or simply burger, is a food consisting of
fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed
inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburger are often served
with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles or chilis;
condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a
"special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing;
and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped
with cheese is called a cheese burger.
